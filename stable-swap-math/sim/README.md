# `stable-swap-sim`

Simulations of the StableSwap invariant compared to Curve's reference implementation.

## Background

The Saber StableSwap program is built to be faithful to Curve's StableSwap invariant. This package contains a simulator which ensures that the output of the Saber Rust code is equivalent to that of Curve's Python reference implementation.
